### Features

1. **Add a Website**
   - Users can add a website by entering the **Website Name** and its **URL** into two input fields.
   - Once the user clicks the **Submit** button, the website details are saved in the browser’s `localStorage`, allowing the data to persist across sessions.
   - The newly added bookmark is also displayed immediately in a table on the page.

2. **Display Bookmarks in a Table**
   - The bookmarks are shown in a table format, displaying both the **Website Name** and the **URL**.
   - For each website entry, there are action buttons to **Visit**, **Update**, or **Delete** the bookmark.

3. **Visit a Website**
   - Each entry includes a **Visit** button, which opens the corresponding website in a new browser tab.
   - This allows users to quickly navigate to any of their saved websites without manually entering the URL.

4. **Update a Bookmark**
   - Users can update the details of any saved website. By clicking the **Update** button, the relevant website’s name and URL are populated back into the input fields, allowing the user to edit and save the changes.
   - Once updated, the changes are reflected both in the table and in `localStorage`.

5. **Delete a Bookmark**
   - A **Delete** button allows users to remove a bookmark from the list. Once deleted, the entry is removed from both the table and `localStorage`.

6. **Search for a Website**
   - A **Search** input field is provided, allowing users to search for websites by name. As the user types, the displayed table of bookmarks is filtered to only show matches based on the input.
   - This makes it easier to find specific bookmarks, especially when dealing with a large number of saved websites.44
